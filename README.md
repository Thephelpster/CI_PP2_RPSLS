# Design
## Design Choices
When choosing the design for this website I decided to go with fairly neutral greens so that the bright images of the game would stand out.

## Colour
When picking the colours for this website I used the Colorspace colour generator to help find ones that would complement each other on the screen.

## Fonts
To  find the fonts I  wanted to use, I  searched through the google fonts webpage to find two different but complementary fonts.

# Features
## Existing Features
Favicon
The first feature on the website is the use of a favicon on every page’s tab. The favicon is a much smaller version of the website logo that changes depending on what device it’s being shown on.

![favicon 16x16](./assets/icons/favicon-16x16.png) ![favicon 32x32](./assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png)

Game Buttons
The game buttons are the most important element that you can see on the page. They are the elements that allow the user to be able to play the game. This is why they are the most colourful and eye catching of the whole page. They also change colour when you've selected them as part of the game.

User stories covered: 1, 7

![game-buttons](./assets/readme-images/game-buttons.png)

Score Area
The score area is an important part of the game as it shows the user their score compared to the AI's score and lets them know if they have won or lost the round.

User stories covered: 3, 4

![score-area](./assets/readme-images/score-area.png)

Reset Button
The reset button is located just below the score area so if the user wants to reset the game without reloading the page they can.

User stories covered: 7

![reset-button](./assets/readme-images/reset-button.png)

# Acknowledgements
This has been a far more challenging build as it took me a lot longer to get to grips with JS and testing the elements to make sure they all worked as I wanted them to. I restarted this project twice before finally getting to this version but in the end it has helped me understand JS a lot better than before starting this project.

I'd like to thank these people who gave me all the help and support I needed to finish and make this project look as good as it does.

* Mo Shami, my mentor, for all the guidance, help and advice.
* Kate Cleal, my partner, for designing the 404 page image, the logo image, the game buttons and being my spell checker for all the text and giving me the time to be able to complete this project.
