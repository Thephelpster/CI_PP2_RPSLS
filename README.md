# Design
## Design Choices
I've chosen the design style based on using a colourful background, text and logo to give a friendly feel to the website and by extension, the company. The colours also tie in with the colours chosen for the uniforms and signage at the factory.

## Colour
When  picking the colours for this  website I  used the Colorspace  colour generator to help find ones  that would complement each other on the screen. The  base colours also had to be in keeping with the colours of The  Campervan Factory’s  sign that is visible in some of the images.
After  I  picked my base colours,  I  then edited them slightly when called for. For example,  softening  the colours and making the text box backgrounds slightly transparent.

![Colour Generator](./assets/readme-images/colour-generator.png)

## Fonts
To  find the fonts I  wanted to use, I  searched through the google fonts webpage to find two different but complementary fonts.

# Features
## Existing Features
### Favicon
The first feature on the website is the use of a favicon on every page’s  tab. The  favicon is a much smaller version of the main company logo that changes depending on what device  it’s  being shown on.

![favicon 16x16](./assets/icon/favicon-16x16.png) ![favicon 32x32](./assets/icon/favicon-32x32.png)

### Navbar
The navbar has links to all pages and all links work when selected. I used the same design and sizing across the website to keep a consistent and professional structure.  The navbar also collapses  when appearing  on a different sized screen, for example, a  mobile device.

![Navbar large](./assets/readme-images/navbar-large.png)
![Navbar Mobile](./assets/readme-images/navbar-mobile.png)

### First Page Carousel
The carousel on the home page is the first feature you see alongside  the navbar. It cycles through three images of campervans  giving the user  an idea of what the campervans look like straight  away.

![Home Page Carousel](./assets/readme-images/carousel-home-page.png)

### Company Background Information and Background Image
This is the first paragraph of information explaining about the company and giving the user  a feel for what they are buying into.

The paragraph is also accompanied  by a background image that shows the workshop. The text is framed in a slightly transparent  box so the image behind is still visible but doesn’t  make the text hard to read.


User stories covered: 1, 2 and 14

![Background Info and Carousel Images](./assets/readme-images/general-company-information.png)

### Newsletter Signup
This section of page allows the user   to  keep up to date with the latest information coming from The Campervan Factory . It’s  a good way for potential customers to find out more information. 

The newsletter form includes placeholder text, fields that must be completed and clearly marked labels for each field.


User stories covered: 13

![Newsletter](./assets/readme-images/newsletter-signup.png)

### Footer
The footer is made up of links to the company’s social media pages to keep potential and existing customer up to date with any new information. The use of multiple social media platforms allows the company to reach a much wider audience.

The footer is consistently in the same position and has the same layout making it easy to find and navigate to the links regardless of which part of the site the user is on. 


User stories covered: 4

![Footer](./assets/readme-images/footer.png)

### About Page Information
Most of this page is information based,  giving the viewer a better understanding of the company and the  reassurance  that the conversions are built professionally . I used background images to break up  the text to make the page more enjoyable to read through.

The design has been mirrored from the previous  pages to  add consistency and harmonisation throughout the website. 


User stories covered: 1, 2, 8 and 14

![About page information](./assets/readme-images/about-page-information.png)

### BBC Points West Interview Video
This video gives the user  an  idea of the day-to-day  workings within The Campervan Factory.  Having been filmed during the Covid-19 pandemic, it shows the company’s growing popularity in a time when people were not able to immediately use the campervans they were purchasing. 

I left out auto play  on this video and  included video controls so that the user  can  decide if/when  they want  to watch the video. 


User stories covered: 1, 2, 5, 8 and 14

![BBC Interview Video](./assets/readme-images/interview-video.png)

### The Conversion Page
The  conversion page uses many of the existing  features but in a different layout. This  continues to keep the website consistent and uniform. It also sets out the information so that it’s not overwhelming for the user.  Elements that have been used again are, text in coloured boxes, a video  and a carousel.

Similar to the video on the about page, I left out auto play on this one with video controls included.  


User stories covered: 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 14 and 16

![Conversion Page](./assets/readme-images/conversion-page.png)

### Contact Table
On the contact page I  used a table to layout the contact  information, making it easy and clear for the user   to  find the information and get in contact with the company. Using  a table to compile this  information will also make it easy for any future changes to be made, for example, if the telephone number or email address changes.  

User stories covered: 10 and 6

![Contact Table](./assets/readme-images/contact-table.png)

### Contact Form
Another  way to contact the company is through the contact form I  added to the page. This  gives the user  a quick and easy way to contact the company.  

Unlike  the form on the first page,  this one includes a text box that the user  can input any question, concern or comment they may have. 

User stories covered: 9

![Contact Form](./assets/readme-images/contact-form.png)

### Google Map iframe
A google map iframe has been added to the bottom of the contact page giving the user  the ability to find where the workshop is with ease. This  allows the user  to be able to visit  the workshop and get a first-hand  view of how campervans are built and view any finished vans.

User stories covered: 11

![Google Map iframe](./assets/readme-images/google-map-iframe.png)

### Gallery Page
The gallery page also doubles as a review page so users  can read what existing customers have to say about the campervan they purchased and the company.  Each  review has corresponding  images that were taken by  the customers showing off their  campervans on different adventures all over the world. 

User stories covered: 3, 15

![Review Section](./assets/readme-images/gallery-review.png)

## Future Features
To  include a way of posting reviews on the page directly instead of the site owner posting these manually. There are a couple of reasons for this, firstly, manually posting them gives the impression that the company are cherry-picking the good reviews. Secondly, it will take less time for the reviews to be added to the site as they will be added immediately rather than waiting for the site owner to manually add them.
